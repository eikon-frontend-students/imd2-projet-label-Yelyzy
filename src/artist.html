            <p class="intro">Justice is a French electronic music duo formed in 2003 by Gaspard Augé and Xavier de Rosnay. Hailing from Paris, they quickly emerged as pioneers of the electro house genre, blending aggressive synth sounds, distorted vocals, and a raw, energetic aesthetic.</p>
              <div class="info">
                <p>Their debut album, † (pronounced “Cross”), released in 2007, catapulted them to international fame. Singles like “We Are Your Friends,” “D.A.N.C.E.,” and “Waters of Nazareth” became anthems, known for their infectious melodies, heavy basslines, and innovative sound design. The album’s distinctive cover art, featuring a stylized cross, further solidified their unique visual identity. </p>
                <p>Justice’s live shows are legendary, characterized by a high-energy, often chaotic stage presence. Their performances feature a mesmerizing blend of lights, visuals, and pyrotechnics, creating an immersive and unforgettable experience for audiences. Following †, Justice released Audio, Video, Disco in 2011, showcasing a more experimental and diverse sound, incorporating elements of disco, funk, and rock into their electronic framework.</p>
                <p>Though their output has been relatively sparse since then, Justice remains a highly influential act in electronic music. Their innovative sound and captivating live shows have left an enduring impact on the genre and continue to inspire a new generation of artists.</p>
